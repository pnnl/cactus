# How to contribute

Hello there. Looks like you are interested in contributing to [cactus](https://github.com/pnnl/cactus), which is just great, so welcome!
  
We are open to any kind of contribution: code, documentation, bug-fixing (even just reports), feature-requests and anything else you may come up with.

## Getting started

### Discussion

Discussions should be the first line of contact for new users to provide direct feedback on the library.
Post your Ideas for new features or examples, showcase your work using cactus in Show and tell, or get support for usage in Q&As, please post them in one of our categories.

## Contributing

### Coding

Nothing fancy here, just:

1. Fork this repo
1. Commit you code
1. Submit a pull request. It will be reviewed by maintainers and they'll give you proper feedback so you can iterate over it.

#### Considerations
- Make sure existing tests pass
- Make sure your new code is properly tested and fully-covered
- Following [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) is highly encouraged
- When adding a new feature, branch from [master-branch](<project-master-branch>)


### Testing

As mentioned above, existing tests must pass and new features are required to be tested and fully-covered.

### Documenting

Code should be self-documented. But, in case there is any code that may be hard to understand, it must include some comments to make it easier to review and maintain later on.
