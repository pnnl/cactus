# Overview

This folder contains notebooks that act as tutorials for using CACTUS and understanding the agent behind its functionallity.
To start using LangChain and CACTUS agents effectively, you need to add your API keys. 
The Google Colab CACTUS notebook walks you through this process in more detail, but for a quick preperation overview, API keys can be obtained from the following links. Please note account creation or connection may be required for each individual user:

# LangChain: Large Language Model Agents Chains 💬

## Introduction

LangChain is a versatile tool for building Large Language Model (LLM) agents. These agents are LLMs equipped with tools to perform specific tasks. For instance, configuring a database or accessing the internet can be achieved using LangChain agents.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial guides you through creating an SQL Database manager using LangChain. You will learn how to load a local LLM via vllm and utilize API-based models like GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, or Claude.

# CACTUS 🌵 | Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool Usage to Science

## Introduction

Leveraging the power of LangChain and agent engineering, CACTUS is able to connect the leading and state-of-the-art LLM models to essential cheminformatics tools. This creates an ever growing path of possibility when applied to drug design and molecular analysis while bolstering explainability.
